### Future Features

## Testing

### Development Process

Throughout the development process, each feature added was manually tested locally to ensure it worked as intended. Once I was happy with the result whilst in localhost, I would then add, commit and push to GitHub. This resulted in realtime changes and adjustments before committing the new code through to main.
<br>
This particularly enabled me to highlight styling issues where I predominantly used bootstrap and then customised accordingly in a separate style.css. For instance, on one circumstance through the debugging process I found that bootstrap had used !important. Although not best practice, I had to use this in my own css to be able to override it.

### Usability Testing

All text throughout the site has been styled to be clear and easy to ready. Although the background is an image through out the website, I used a translucent layer between this and text to ensure it was still readable.
<br>
Within my colour scheme, I also ensure I had an accent colour which I was able to use to direct the user to the next steps.
